//! A crate for generating large prime numbers, suitable for cryptography.
//!
//! Primes are generated similarly to OpenSSL except it applies some recommendations
//! from the [Prime and Prejudice](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/749.pdf).
//!
//! 1. Generate a random odd number of a given bit-length.
//! 2. Divide the candidate by the first 2048 prime numbers
//! 3. Test the candidate with Fermat's Theorem.
//! 4. Runs Baillie-PSW test with `log2(bits) + 5` Miller-Rabin tests
